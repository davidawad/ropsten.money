callback endpoint from payment provider for delivery of ropsten ETH. No longer in business post ETH merge. 

This is the backend that delivered rETH to users that purchased eth through [gumroad](https://davidawad.gumroad.com/l/ropsten). 

The backend would take the request from the payment gateway after purchase and deliver ETH to the specified address. 

It was a fun project, and can now be open sourced as the MERGE is complete and the ropsten network has been deprecated.

Thanks again to all who purchased rETH through the platform.
